    <h1>Treasure Island Paradise</h1>
    <h2>Where the best booty has nothing to do with treasure</h2>
    <h4>Does this sound familar</h4>
      <p class="x-list"><img class="x" src="img/ink-x.png" alt="x mark">Ordering your underlings to Swab the poop-deck doesn't create
        the same sense of gruff satisfaction that it usually does</p>
      <p class="x-list"><img class="x" src="img/ink-x.png" alt="x mark">Counting your treasure doesn't stir as much joy if there is
        no one to spend it on</p>
      <p class="x-list"><img class="x" src="img/ink-x.png" alt="x mark">You feel like there is something missing, but it has nothing
        to do with your peg leg or hook?</p>
      <p class="x-list"><img class="x" src="img/ink-x.png" alt="x mark">Usually your parrots repeating of your own commands adds to your appreciation of your grand greatness,
        but now it comes off as a annoying echo-y chicken on your shoulder?</p>
      <p class="x-list"><img class="x" src="img/ink-x.png" alt="x mark">Have you stopped taking pride in your hat or beard, because who the heck cares?</p>
    <h3>Well then Treasure island may be the X that marks the spot on your map!</h3>
